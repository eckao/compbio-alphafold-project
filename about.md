# About Our Project
AlphaFold is an incredibly useful tool that uses multiple-sequence alignment to predict protein structure. The most recent version of Alphafold (Alphafold2) uses coupled sub-networks based on pattern recognition and relationships between amino acids in a concept-dependent manner as derived from training data. Alphafold2, while better at predicting protein structure than Alphafold1, is not good at predicting the structure of proteins that are intrinsically disordered (fold differently in the presence of different protein subunits), multi-unit heteromeric proteins, or proteins that interact with organic molecules, metals, or co-factors in order to assume the appropriate conformation. We seek to more succinctly identify and describe the failings of Alphafold and why certain inputs aren’t compatible with Alphafold’s current algorithm.

Understanding the 3D structure of proteins is incredibly useful, as proteins form the basis of most drug and therapeutic treatment targets, but deriving this structures experimentally can be cost-prohibitive. Alphafold helps decrease the cost of this critical component of protein analysis and dynamics, but for a very specific set of proteins. Understanding why Alphafold doesn’t work for large classes of proteins could help with its future implementation for these proteins.

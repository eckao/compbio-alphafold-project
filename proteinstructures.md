# Proteins and the Protein-Folding Problem: Introduction to Proteins and their Structures  
## What is a protein? <br>
Proteins are biomolecules made up of amino acids, the sequence of which determines the structure and function of each protein. In biological systems, proteins play complex and critical roles, larely responsible for structure, function, and regulation of a system’s tissues and organs.

## Orders of protein structure
### 1. Primary
Primary structure is the sequence of amino acids making up a polypeptide chain. 

Amino acids usually have the following structural properties:
- A carbon (the alpha carbon) bonded to the four groups below:
- A hydrogen atom (H)
- A Carboxyl group (-COOH)
- An Amino group (-NH2)
- A "R" group or "variable" group

### 2. Secondary
Secondary structure is local folded structures that form within a polypeptide resulting from interactions between atoms of the backbone. The backbone refers to the polypeptide chain not including the R group.  

There are two types of secondary structures seen in proteins.
- alpha (α) helix - looks like a coiled spring
- beta (β) pleated sheet - looks like its folded or pleated

### 3. Tertiary
Tertiary structure results from interactions between the R groups of the amino acids that make up the protein. This is the overall three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide. 
- Non-covalent bonds influencing interactions:
  - hydrogen bonding
  - ionic bonding
  - dipole-dipole interactions
  - London dispersion forces 
  - Hydrogen bonding 
- Hydrophobic interactions
  - nonpolar, hydrophobic R groups cluster on inside of protein, while hydrophilic amino acids are on the outside interacting with surrounding water
- Covalent bond
  - Disulfide bond are covalent linkages between sulfur-containing side chains of cysteines
    - Stronger than the other types of bonds that contribute to tertiary structure

### 4. Quaternary
While many proteins are made of a singular polypeptide chain and have three structural levels, some are made up of multiple chains or subunits. When the subunits come together, a protein gets its quaternary structure. The types of interactions that are part of tertiary structures are usually the same ones that hold subunits together that give proteins quaternary structure. This involves interactions such as London disperson forces and hydrogen bonding.

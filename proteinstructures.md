# Introduction to Proteins and their Structures  
## What is a protein? <br>
## Orders of protein structure
### 1. Primary
Primary structure is the sequence of amino acids making up a polypeptide chain. 

Amino acids usually have the following structural properties:
- A carbon (the alpha carbon) bonded to the four groups below:
- A hydrogen atom (H)
- A Carboxyl group (-COOH)
- An Amino group (-NH2)
- A "R" group or "variable" group

### 2. Secondary
Secondary structure is local folded structures that form within a polypeptide resulting from interactions between atoms of the backbone. The backbone refers to the polypeptide chain not including the R group.  

There are two types of secondary structures seen in proteins.
- alpha (α) helix - looks like a coiled spring
- beta (β) pleated sheet - looks like its folded or pleated

### 3. Tertiary
Tertiary structure results from interactions between the R groups of the amino acids that make up the protein. This is the overall three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide. 
- Non-covalent bonds influencing interactions:
  - hydrogen bonding
  - ionic bonding
  - dipole-dipole interactions
  - London dispersion forces 
  - Hydrogen bonding 
- Hydrophobic interactions
  - nonpolar, hydrophobic R groups cluster on inside of protein, while hydrophilic amino acids are on the outside interacting with surrounding water
- Covalent bond
  - Disulfide bond are covalent linkages between sulfur-containing side chains of cysteines
    - Stronger than the other types of bonds that contribute to tertiary structure
